        <h1>Privacy Policy for QRCobot</h1>
        
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2025</p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how QRCobot ("we", "our", or "the app") handles information when you use our mobile application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not collect any personal data or information from users of QRCobot.</strong></p>
        <p>QRCobot is designed to operate entirely on your device. All QR code and barcode generation, scanning, and storage functions are performed locally on your device without transmitting any data to external servers.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All data created and stored within QRCobot, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>QR codes you generate</li>
            <li>Bar codes you generate</li>
            <li>Favourite lists (up to 10 QR codes and 20 bar codes)</li>
            <li>Scanned codes and their history</li>
        </ul>
        <p>is stored locally on your device only. This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Camera and Photo Library Access</h2>
        <p>QRCobot requires access to your device's camera and photo library to scan QR codes and bar codes from images. This access is used solely for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scanning QR codes and bar codes in real-time using your camera</li>
            <li>Scanning QR codes and bar codes from images in your photo library</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not store, transmit, or access any images from your camera or photo library beyond what is necessary to perform the scanning function. All processing is done locally on your device.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Widget Functionality</h2>
        <p>QRCobot provides widget functionality that allows you to display your favourite QR codes and bar codes on your device's home screen. The widget accesses only the codes you have saved in your local favourites list, and this data remains on your device.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>QRCobot does not integrate with any third-party analytics services, advertising networks, or data collection services. The app operates independently and does not share any information with third parties.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Apple Watch Support</h2>
        <p>If you use QRCobot on Apple Watch, the app displays QR codes from your local favourites list. No data is transmitted between your iPhone and Apple Watch beyond what is necessary for the app's core functionality, and all data remains on your devices.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>QRCobot is rated for ages 4+ and does not collect any personal information from users of any age. Our app is safe for children to use as it operates entirely locally on the device without any data collection or transmission.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no data for us to share, delete, or modify. All your data is stored locally on your device, and you have full control over it. You can delete the app at any time, which will remove all locally stored data.</p>
