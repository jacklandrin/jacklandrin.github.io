## About hiding new Macbook Notch 

The Hide notch switch only shows on build-in display of M1 Pro/Max Macbook Pro. The switch just controls current desktop, not for all work desktops.
Now, the Hide notch switch supports dynamic wallpaper, just the processing takes much longer time.
## About AirPods Switch 

I use classOfDevice(2360344) to check if a bluetooth device is Airpods Pro, but I'm not sure whether other AirPods modules are also 2360344, since I only have two AriPods Pros. If you are using AirPods 1~3, please tell me what the classOfDevice is. Or I can detect the count of battery value to check if AirPods(when count is 3, it's AirPods), like **AirPods Battery Monitor For MAC OS**.

## About Radio Player
Radio Player supports m3u, acc stream, but without sound wave effect. If your Radio Player crashes, please send the crash log and stream url to me. You can close sound wave effect on Radio setting, and that player is AVPlayer, more stable.

## About Low Power Mode
Low Power Mode uses Terminal commands that require root access, so the app will ask you to enter password on every toggle.

## About Shortcuts
Shortcuts is a powerful iOS app which can help people make fantasitic automation functions. It comes to macOS in Monterey as well. Many users eager OnlySwitch has more customizable features, and one good news is that the app supports Shortcuts display since Version 1.7. More menubar space therefore is saved. 
In the next versions, OnlySwitch will also provide more Shortcuts actions to impove user experience.

Since Version 2.0, keyboard shortcuts can be set for Shortcuts.

</p>

OnlySwitch offers some Shortcus actions since Version 1.8. For example, you can config your own dark mode switch. (**Set Appearance** action by Shortcuts can also set dark mode, but the appearance status cannot be detected. So, OnlySwitch provides a set dark mode action)

## Can't compile preview by Xcode 13.2.1 on some Macs
I found I can't run the preview of SwiftUI by Xcode 13.2.1 on my M1 Pro Macbook. It'll show an error like this https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/697037. Meanwhile, the OnlySwitch status bar icon will be missing, including old version app. However it's normal that I run it on my i7 Macbook. I'm not sure whether this is a bug of Xcode. The current workaround is installing back to Xcode 13.2.

## About Apple's warning at first open
Some users ask me why masOS shows a warning box below, when they first open Only Switch.
<p align="center">
<img alt="Sits in the status bar" src="http://www.jacklandrin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/os_warning.png" width="35%" align="center" />
</p>

Because the app isn't got from App Store, and I use some private API in project. You can at [here](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/apple-cant-check-app-for-malicious-software-mchleab3a043/mac) to learn more about it.
You can follow these steps to use Only Switch.
1. Open System Preference
2. Click Security & Privacy
3. Select General
4. Click **Open Anyway**
5. Finally click Open on the dialog box. Now macOS won't block that you open the app.
