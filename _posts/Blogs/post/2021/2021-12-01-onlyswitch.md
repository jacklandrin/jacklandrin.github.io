_**Menubar is smaller, you only need an All-in-One switch.**_

[**Download the app**](https://github.com/jacklandrin/OnlySwitch/releases/download/release_1.6/OnlySwitch.dmg)

## What's the OnlySwitch?

OnlySwitch provides a series of toggle switches to simply your routine work, such as Hiden desktop icons, dark mode and hide ugly notch of new Mackbook Pro. The switches show on your statusbar, you can easily control them.  
Since Version 1.2, OnlySwitch supports **simplified Chinese** and **German**.

## About hiding new Macbook Notch

The Hide notch switch only shows on build-in display of M1 Pro/Max Macbook Pro. The switch just controls current desktop, not for all work desktops.  
Now, the Hide notch switch supports dynamic wallpaper, just the processing takes much longer time.

## About AirPods Switch

I use classOfDevice(2360344) to check if a bluetooth device is Airpods Pro, but I'm not sure whether other AirPods modules are also 2360344, since I only have two AriPods Pros. If you are using AirPods 1~3, please tell me what the classOfDevice is. Or I can detect the count of battery value to check if AirPods(when count is 3, it's AirPods), like **AirPods Battery Monitor For MAC OS**.

## About Radio Player

Radio Player supports m3u stream since version 1.6, but without sound wave effect. If your Radio Player crashes, please send the crash log and stream url to me.

## Can't compile preview by Xcode 13.2.1 on some Macs

I found I can't run the preview of SwiftUI by Xcode 13.2.1 on my M1 Pro Macbook. It'll show an error like this [https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/697037](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/697037). Meanwhile, the OnlySwitch status bar icon will be missing, including old version app. However it's normal that I run it on my i7 Macbook. I'm not sure whether this is a bug of Xcode. The current workaround is installing back to Xcode 13.2.

## About Apple's warning at first open

Some users ask me why masOS shows a warning box below, when they first open Only Switch.

![Sits in the status bar](/assets/img/images/os_warning.png)

Because the app isn't got from App Store, and I use some private API in project. You can at [here](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/apple-cant-check-app-for-malicious-software-mchleab3a043/mac) to learn more about it.  
You can follow these steps to use Only Switch.

1. Open System Preference
2. Click Security & Privacy
3. Select General
4. Click **Open Anyway**
5. Finally click Open on the dialog box. Now macOS won't block that you open the app.
